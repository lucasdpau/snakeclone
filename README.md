# snakeclone

Here is a clone of the snake game that I made in Javascript. index.html contains a canvas element, which is used by Javascript to render the game.

The snake will automatically move in a straight line until you give it a new direction. Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake.

If the snake hits the edges or itself, the game will restart. If the snake goes over the food, it will grow by one square and the game will continue.
